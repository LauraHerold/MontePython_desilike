# DESI BAO likelihood adapted for MontePython

Adapted DESI 2024/2025 BAO likelihood [desilike](https://github.com/cosmodesi/desilike) to use with [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public). 

The likelihood is an adaptation of the MontePython likelihood for [bao_boss_dr12](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public/tree/3.6/montepython/likelihoods/bao_boss_dr12); the covariance and mean are taken from the [DESI Cobaya likelihood](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/bao_data/tree/master/desi_bao_dr2). 

### ACT DR6 lensing likelihood adapted for MontePython

We additionally provide a MontePython-adapted version of the ACT DR6 lensing likelihood [act_dr6_lenslike](https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/act_dr6_lenslike).

### Notebooks to reproduce plots in: 
- "Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data", L. Herold & M. Kamionkowski, [arXiv:2412.03546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03546).
- "Bayesian and frequentist perspectives agree on dynamical dark energy", L. Herold & T. Karwal [arXiv:2506.12004](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12004).

If you use these likelihoods in your work, consider citing one of the papers. Thanks!
